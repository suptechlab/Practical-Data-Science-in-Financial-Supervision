Ive sent EXPERIAN multiple letters that Im the one whos disputing the items that are UNKNOWN to me. In Experians responses that make the claim that have not initiated any disputes on my behalf due to the fraudulent or high risk nature, and the documents I provided have either been confirmed as fraudulent or deemed as high risk due to the potential for fraud. This is a complete joke. How in the world did they verify these claims? First of all, I know that under FCRA Section 619 Obtaining information under false pretenses that any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18 United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. Most importantly, I never sent my documentation to anyone else as it deemed as high risk due to the potential for fraud. Also, according to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) Determination That Dispute Is Frivolous or Irrelevant ( A ) a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information. ( B ) Notice of determination. Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph ( A ) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. Again, under FCRA 617 Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681o ] Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( 2 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

In XXXX, I get a call from XXXX XXXX that I am 30 days late because no payment was made. I call XXXX to figure out what's going on, and they admitted they never paid off the vehicle like they are supposed to. According to CA Veh Code 11709.4 ( 2022 ), a dealer only has 21 days to pay off a trade in. If I turned in my vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX of 2022, there was no possible way for me to be 30 days late in XXXX of 2022 as the vehicle should have been paid off in XXXX. 

I then spoke with XXXX XXXX and told them I traded in my vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX of 2022 and I even sent them a copy of the paperwork proving so. I asked them to speak with XXXX as well since they were the ones who were supposed to pay this. 
I don't remember exactly what happened or how it happened, but eventually the loan did get paid. It was too late for me and my credit, however. 

I spoke with XXXX to see if they could remove the 30 day late payment since this wasn't my fault. They didn't help me or fix anything. They just kept giving me excuses. I have spent over a year trying to fight with them and XXXX to help me fix this, but no one helps me. I just think its sad that I have to suffer the consequences for something I had no control over or was my fault. When you trade in a vehicle at a dealership, you do so in good faith and under the expectation that they would pay the vehicle off in a timely fashion. I have no way of knowing that they would violate California law and not pay off my loan until after I have been damaged and they have to be called out on their tardiness.

I don't know who this company is plus they have access to my report and they are in possession of my personal information without written or verbal consent which falls under identity theft.

Violations By Your Company : Identity theft concerns and deprivation of rights : The absence of verbal or written consent for the collection and reporting of personal information by third-party debt collectors not only constitutes a flagrant violation of numerous laws and consumer rights protections but also infringes upon deeply held religious beliefs and constitutional rights. This includes : 1. Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S. Code 1692 et seq. ), particularly Sections 807 and 808, by third-party debt collectors who purchase debt without a contractual agreement with the individual they are reporting on. This violates provisions that prohibit debt collectors from making false or misleading representations and from using unfair or unconscionable means to collect debts.

2. Breach of contract laws as third-party debt collectors lack a valid contractual relationship with the individual they are reporting on, failing to establish a legal basis for collecting or reporting the debt. 

3. Potential violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 et seq. ) if the third-party debt collector inaccurately reports or updates debt information to credit bureaus without proper verification or validation, thereby impacting the individual 's creditworthiness unfairly.

4. Failure to comply with state consumer protection laws governing debt collection practices, including requirements for transparency, accuracy, and fair treatment of consumers.

5. Violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) by disclosing sensitive personal information without proper authorization. Third-party debt collectors are restricted from obtaining or disclosing personal information unless explicitly permitted by law or authorized by the individual.

6. Infringement upon the individual 's rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) if the third-party debt collector reports inaccurate or outdated information to credit reporting agencies without conducting a reasonable investigation into the validity of the debt, leading to potential harm to the individual 's credit reputation. Additionally, the third party lacks the "" first-party interest '' necessary to justify the reporting under the FCRA.

Deprivation of religious beliefs and constitutional rights, as protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, by imposing reporting practices that conflict with an individual 's religious beliefs and by infringing upon their right to financial autonomy and privacy, leading to significant damages that deprive individuals of their right to freedom.

It has come to my attention that your agency has reported information that not only inaccurately reflects my credit history but also violates my rights to privacy as outlined in 15 USC 1681 ( Section 604a Section 2 ). 

The relevant details are as follows : Creditor Name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Nature of Inaccuracy : These XXXX late payments XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX should not be reported and reported inaccurately on my credit report.

Creditor Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Nature of Inaccuracy : These XXXX late payments XXXX should not be reported and reported inaccurately in my credit report. 

Furthermore, it has come to my attention that the creditor has violated my rights under 15 USC 1681 ( Section 604a Section 2 ), which states that I have the right to privacy. The FCRA clearly outlines that a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions. Additionally, under 15 USCS 1666b, a creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose.

I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into both the reporting inaccuracies and the violation of my rights under the aforementioned sections of the FCRA. Please provide me with a written explanation of the results of your investigation, including any corrections or deletions made to rectify the inaccuracies. Moreover, I request that you take appropriate action to address the violation of my privacy rights.

If applicable, please forward the corrected information to all entities that received my credit report in the past six months, as required by law.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, and I expect a resolution within the 30-day period mandated by the FCRA. Failure to address these concerns adequately may result in further legal action.

Enclosed with this letter, please find copies of relevant supporting documents, including but not limited to payment records and correspondence with the creditor, to assist in your investigation.

2/14/24,Mortgage,Reverse mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the loan closing,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against American Advisors Group regarding a reverse mortgage issued on a property that I am responsible for. Upon reviewing the loan documents received from the current loan holder, XXXX XXXX  XXXX, it has come to my attention that the property was incorrectly appraised as a single-family residence valued at {$720000.00}. In reality, the property has a 1973 mobile home that is NOT on a permanent foundation. 

The appraisal error has led to the misclassification of the property, as all of the loan documents and necessary HUD approvals refer to is as a single-family residence. This misclassification has rendered the property ineligible for the type of reverse mortgage that was issued. It is evident that the proper inspections and due diligence were not conducted during the loan application process, which has resulted in a fraudulent loan being issued. 

I only became aware of the reverse mortgage upon the passing of the borrower. The current loan holder, XXXX XXXX  XXXX, has informed me that I would need to take it up with the issuer, American Advisors Group.

As a customer of Credit Bureaus, I expect transparency, reliability, and prompt action in addressing such matters. 

I have made several attempts to report and have fraudulent items removed from my credit file. However, despite my efforts and numerous notifications, these items continue to exist unabated. This not only undermines my trust in your organization 's integrity but also poses a significant risk to my personal information and financial security. 
It is unacceptable that such discrepancies persist despite being brought to your attention multiple times. 
I urge you to take immediate and decisive action to rectify this situation. Specifically, I request the following actions : Conduct a thorough investigation into the root cause of the issue, including any potential vulnerabilities in your systems or processes that may be enabling fraudulent activities to persist.

Implement robust measures to prevent further occurrences of fraudulent items and ensure the security of customer accounts and data.

Provide clear and timely communication to affected customers, including updates on the status of investigations and actions taken to address the issue.

Offer appropriate compensation or restitution to customers who have been adversely affected by the presence of fraudulent items, such as refunds or account credits.

Review and improve your customer support and complaint resolution procedures to ensure that issues are addressed promptly and effectively in the future.

I expect a prompt response to this complaint and a commitment from Credit Bureaus to address these concerns with the seriousness and urgency they deserve. Failure to do so will force me to consider alternative courses of action, including escalating this matter to relevant regulatory authorities or seeking legal recourse.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., specifically 1681b, and North Carolina General Statutes 75-64, subsection ( a ) ( 4 ), I am compelled to address a matter of utmost importance concerning my credit profile. 

Upon meticulous review of my consumer report, I have identified unauthorized inquiries from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and EQUIFAX MORTGAGE SER, severely impacting my creditworthiness. This not only infringes upon the FCRA but also constitutes identity fraud, as explicitly defined by the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act - 18 U.S.C. 1028 ( a ) ( 7 ). 

I assert, with unwavering confidence, that even within the scope of a permissible purpose, the consent of the consumer is indispensable, as stipulated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) - 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq., particularly 6802 ( e ) ( 1 ). In these instances, no such consent has been granted. 

The adverse impact on my creditworthiness, a direct violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ( ECPA ) - 18 U.S.C. 2510-2522, especially 2511 ( 1 ) ( c ), is intolerable. In alignment with North Carolina General Statutes 75-64, subsection ( b ) ( 2 ), I insist that immediate action be taken to rectify this situation. 

I maintain that these items are unverifiable, invoking the Privacy Act of 1974 - 5 U.S.C. 552a, particularly 552a ( d ) ( 1 ). I, therefore, demand that, in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( CFAA ) - 18 U.S.C. 1030 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( C ), Equifax expeditiously deletes these unauthorized and unverifiable items from my consumer report within the next 30 days. 

Failure to do so will be construed as willful noncompliance on the part of Equifax, an offense for which you can be held civilly liable, as explicitly stated in 1030 ( g ) of the CFAA. 

Your prompt and unequivocal attention to this matter are non-negotiable. I expect a swift resolution, and I anticipate written confirmation once the unauthorized inquiries have been expunged from my consumer report.

Recently, I discovered numerous unauthorized transactions on my PayPal Credit account, specifically linked to purchases at XXXX. These transactions were not initiated by me, and I promptly disputed them with Synchrony Bank, providing all necessary documentation and details for investigation. Despite my efforts, Synchrony Bank has failed to complete the claim process and credit my account for all the unauthorized transactions. 

As a result, a significant number of fraudulent transactions remain unresolved, causing considerable financial distress and uncertainty. Despite my repeated attempts to seek resolution from Synchrony Bank, they have not provided a satisfactory response or timeline for resolving the outstanding disputes. 

Furthermore, instead of addressing the issue in good faith, Synchrony Bank has taken retaliatory actions against me by unilaterally reducing the credit limit on my PayPal account. This action not only exacerbates the financial strain caused by the unresolved transactions but also demonstrates a lack of accountability and customer care on the part of Synchrony Bank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,NV,89110,,Consent provided,Web,2/8/24,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,8310836

I have sent multiple letters to the credit reporting agencies disputing the accuracy of the late payments, citing laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Fair Credit Billing Act. In response, the credit reporting agencies claimed to have verified the accuracy of their reporting, without providing any evidence or documentation to support their claims. 
I have also sent a letter to the creditor disputing the late payments, and demanding the immediate removal of the late payments from my account, as well as the production of documentation such as transactional history, billing statements, and any other documents that the law allows me to request from creditors regarding billing errors. The creditor has failed to respond to my request.

2/18/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing this letter to formally dispute the information contained in my consumer report, as provided by your agency. After a thorough review of my report, I have discovered that undisclosed personal information about me has been shared with a non-affiliated third party without my explicit written consent. This discovery raises serious concerns as it appears to be a violation of the regulations outlined in 15 U.S. Code 6802 - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I understand that I have the right to be informed about and control the disclosure of my personal information. The disclosure to a non-affiliated third party without affording me the opportunity to opt-out, as mandated by law, is a direct infringement on my privacy rights. Upon meticulous examination of the report, I observed that specific accounts are being reported without my explicit written consent. It is essential to clarify that my dispute is not with the creditor but with your reporting agency for disseminating and reporting information without proper authorization. I specifically refer to 15 USC 1681b - Permissible Purpose, which mandates a consumer 's written consent for the reporting of personal information. As of now, I have not provided such written consent, and I request documentation to substantiate my consent, thereby ensuring compliance with this legal requirement. Failure to provide evidence of my consent could be interpreted as a violation of my rights under the FCRA. I am under the belief that the unauthorized disclosure and reporting of my personal information may constitute a violation under 18 USC 1028a, potentially constituting identity theft. In accordance with 15 USC 1681c-2, I formally request the removal of the following accounts from my consumer report within five ( 5 ) business days from the date of this letter. I emphasize my right to a fair and accurate credit reporting process, and the swift removal of this account from each credit bureau is crucial to rectifying the reported inaccuracies. Furthermore, I request documentation regarding your method of verification for the disputed accounts and records showing proof of my option to opt out of the information being reported in my consumer report. This will ensure that your reporting agency adheres to the necessary standards for accuracy and fairness in credit reporting. I anticipate your prompt attention to this matter and the resolution of my dispute within the specified timeframe of five ( 5 ) business days. Non-compliance with the provisions of the FCRA may result in further legal action.

Now, I have no money. I'm late on bills, plus late fees for not paying on time.

1. Request for Assistance Regarding Auto Loan Account with Truist Bank Dear Consumer Protection Agency, I am reaching out to you for assistance regarding an issue I am facing with my auto loan account at Truist Bank. 
I have been unable to access my online account to make payments towards my auto loan. This has caused me significant concern, especially considering that I have already made substantial payments towards this loan, totaling over {$18000.00} over the years. 
According to my understanding of the terms associated with my XXXX  XXXX filing status, I should have received a notice from Truist Bank, assuring me that there will be no attempts to repossess my property. However, I have not received any such communication. This lack of communication has led me to worry about the security of my property and the transparency of Truist Banks processes. 
I kindly request your intervention in this matter. I seek clarity on why I am unable to access my online account and assurance that my property will not be repossessed without proper notice. 
I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your assistance in resolving these issues.

SOFT AND HARD PRMOTIONAL INQUIRIES. I DID NOT GIVE VERBA/NON VERBAL CONSENTFOR THIS INFORMATION TO BE LISTED IN MY CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT. PER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT- 15 U.S. Code 1681 - Congressional findings and statement of purpose a ) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting The Congress makes the following findings : ( 4 ) There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

( b ) Reasonable procedures It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner, which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.

As you can see there is a need to protect your right to privacy.

Important Definitions from 15 U.S. Code 1681a - Definitions ; rules of construction The term consumer reporting agency means any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.

The term consumer means an individual.

The term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumers credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living ( 2 ) Exclusions ( A ) ( i ) report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report ; Reporting Transaction history is illegal 15 U.S. Code 1681b - Permissible purposes of consumer reports Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

They need your written consent to add anything to your consumer report if you did not give this authorization that is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ( 1 ) Prohibition ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.

Once you notify the consumer agencies that there is inaccurate information they must immediately stop reporting that information until they can prove that it is valid.

Those are a few violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that you can use in your complaint against not only the reporting agencies but the furnisher of that information to them.

Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) Important Definitions ( 4 ) the term record means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph ; This includes consumer reports. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681 section 602 a states "" There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. '' XXXX and XXXX are consumer reporting agencies and I am the Consumer. I have the right to make sure my private information isn't shared which is backed by 15 USC 6801 which states '' It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) is a financial institution by definition under that title. 15 USC 1681 section 604 a section 2 states that "" In general Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) the financial institution and the Consumer reporting agencies XXXX and XXXX do not have my consent to furnish this information and they surely do not have my written consent. Any and all consent to XXXX, XXXX, ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) whether it be verbal, non-verbal, written, implied or otherwise is revoked. 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) states that "" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) Never informed me of my right to exercise my nondisclosure option. Not only that 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ) states '' Except as authorized under subsection ( b ), no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information Any other adverse item of information, other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years. '' This account is an adverse item they are reporting again without my permission which is against the law. 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A states "" A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 15 U.S. Code 1681e states '' Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title. XXXX and XXXX are not maintaining reasonable procedures. Also 12 CFR 1016.7 states that "" A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.

4/5/24,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally dispute the collection account listed on my consumer report by your agency. Upon reviewing the pertinent consumer protection laws, I have identified multiple violations of my rights as a consumer under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regulations. Firstly, under 12 CFR 1006.34 ( b ) ( 5 ), your agency is obligated to provide validation information regarding the debt in question. However, despite my requests, no such information has been provided, yet you have proceeded to report the collection on my consumer report. This is a clear violation of my rights as outlined in the aforementioned regulation. Secondly, I have not been afforded the opportunity to dispute the account, as required by 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ). It is imperative that consumers are given the chance to challenge the validity of a debt before it is reported to consumer reporting agencies, yet this fundamental right has been denied to me. Furthermore, it has come to my attention that your agency has engaged in deceptive practices, including false, misleading, and misrepresented information. Such actions are in direct violation of consumer protection laws and undermine the integrity of the debt collection process. Lastly, your agency has furnished this account to consumer reporting agencies without providing the necessary disclosures required by law. This egregious disregard for legal obligations is unacceptable and further demonstrates your agency 's disregard for consumer rights. In light of these violations, I demand that you cease all collection activities related to this account and immediately remove it from my consumer report. Failure to comply will result in further action being taken, including but not limited to filing complaints with the appropriate regulatory authorities and pursuing legal recourse. I expect a prompt response to this dispute and a resolution to this matter within [ insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days ] days of receipt of this letter. Please provide confirmation of the actions taken to address these concerns.

3/28/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","1. I completed this complaint one time tonight already and I don't see it. 
2. I am complaining about PHH not sending me statements for monthly payments, when I requested which started back in XX/XX/XXXX. 
3. Due to an adversarial divorce, and the co borrower being delinquent on this loan since XXXX i requested that we both get copies of the statements- but PHH stated they could not do this. PHH knew that the ex-spouse wanted to try and foreclose on the house since XXXX-but I didn't. 
4. So every time PHH would decide I would get the monthly statements the ex-spouse would call in to stop me from receiving them. 
5. Also every time I did go into a loan modification to try and get a loan modification on my own- i would pay trial payments and then the ex-spouse would call and tell them to stop. 
6. I didn't know of any other recourse other than to file a XXXX  XXXX to stop the foreclosure- but somehow, he would interfere with the XXXX XXXX and get it dismissed. 
7. Moving on- I filed a complaint with the CFPB regarding what had been happening- that PHH would not allow me to go into a loan modification, since the delinquent co borrower didn't want it- even though I was paying the mortgage. 
8. PHH then wrote a letter to me based on what CFPB advised them to do- stating that in order for me to get a loan modification and get him removed from the loan- i would need a court order- from a family court judge that would allow me to sign a loan modification on my own even in the event if the co borrower didn't agree since he was the one that was setting the home up for foreclosure. Also, I needed to execute a quit claim deed and then apply for a loan assumption removing him from the loan. 
9. On XX/XX/XXXX a court order allowed me to do everything the letter that PHH wrote to me to give to the court. 
10. I got a permanent loan modification in XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received the application to assume the loan- but it couldn't be done until I had the ex-spouse removed from the deed. 
12. I got him removed from the deed in XX/XX/XXXX. 
13. However, in XX/XX/XXXX the ex-spouse and his attorney managed to go back to court misrepresenting facts an trying to relitigate old information. Also, the judge forgot what he ordered me to do on XXXX he said he didn't recall he ordered me to do this. So he admonished me by taking away 50 % of military retirement pension-since I had signed his name on quit claim deed. 
14. So after XXXX i requested a forbearance and was granted one. I was only XXXX behind instead of being nearly XXXX dollars behind. 
15. In XX/XX/XXXX the ex-spouse took the XX/XX/XXXX Arizona order to Georgia and filed a XXXX XXXX XXXX against me and PHH. 
16. The ex-spouse had no authority to do this- because the XX/XX/XXXX order was still valid- and the XX/XX/XXXX order didn't tell him to go to Georgia and file an action and try and take the house away. 
17. During this time starting in XXXX XXXX PHH started to not communicate with me- and I was never sent any monthly mortgage statements until XXXX XXXX when the house was about to go into foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. 
18. I had tried telephoning PHH during the litigation and they would not accept my phone calls- i requested that they send me copies of my monthly statements- but they never did. 
19. I am still in pending litigation at the Court of Appeal level fighting this XXXX XXXX XXXX  that was wrongfully filed in the wrong county and now this wrongful foreclosure based on this quiet title action. 
20. Again, PHH jut notified me on XX/XX/XXXX, that my home was going to be foreclosed on as of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX 21. PHH also had reversed my permanent loan modification and the quit claim deed that was executed per the AZ family court orders. 
22. So instead of being XXXX behind due to the hardship- i get this statement now that says I'm XXXX behind- and the only option I have is to pay the XXXX. 
23. I have written a postponement request to PHH stating that they I was only made aware of this foreclosure on XXXX XXXX and requesting that they stop the foreclosure immediately- and that I am also in an appeal in the Georgia court of appeals- as well as the Arizona court of appeals surrounding this entire deceptive matter of making the house crash and burn to a foreclosure brought on by the ex-spouse. 
24, Again no statements when I requested as a reasonable accommodation to my XXXX that I receive monthly statements as well- as the ex-spouse.- XXXX. Also, the ex-spouse has not paid anything on this house since XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Ocwen Financial Corporation,AZ,85201,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/28/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8644966

3/25/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,I am the co-signer of my daughters student loan with Sallie Mae. Last year XXXX we reach out the when we found out my daughter would not be able to pay the full amount now that Covid was over. She was paying {$420.00} per month and her new amount would have been {$820.00} per month starting XXXX. At that time she was unemployed and I had just retired so I couldnt help her. We were told theres nothing they can do until it goes to the collection dept. Meanwhile everyday they would call and I would tell the the same thing. My XXXX died in XXXX and I ask them to give us some time to grieve and get our finances together which they didnt because they were calling everyday and I ignore the calls. Finally I buried my XXXX  in XXXX. In XXXX I finally responded to one of their phone call. I was told I was being referred to the account manager. We spoke. He took some information from me. He said I can put you in a program but you would have to pay XXXX consecutive payments of {$480.00} for the next XXXX months and then after that for XXXX years at a lower interest rate. I agreed and thought ok thats that. I notice I was still getting the phone calls but I ignored them because I know they have been getting the payments. Then my bank sent me a notice there was a drop in my credit score because of delinquent payments. I was surprise because I know they were taking out the payments monthly. I reached out to Sallie Mae was told dont worry about it it will clear up after XXXX because thats when youll be finish with your third payment. XXXX come I go to apply for a car loan was denied because of recent delinquent payments. When I check my report there were XXXX delinquent payments because of there are XXXX loans. As a result I had to pay {$2000.00} extra to get a car loan because my credit score took a big hit because of what they reported. When I finally spoke to someone regarding what happened the only thing I was told was whoever I spoke with gave me wrong info and theres and outstanding balance that I need to pay to get me uptodate and stop the delinquent notice. That mistake cost me thousands of dollars and will be on my credit report for awhile. What about accountability. At no point in time did anyone that I spoke with mention me having to pay additional money to bring my account up to date until I reach out again after the XXXX delinquencies. How can you be delinquent while making payments?,Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,SLM CORPORATION,NY,10977,Older American,Consent provided,Web,3/25/24,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,8623897

I had recently battled the same company on an alleged first lien that they were fraudulently claiming ownership of and it turns out they not only lied here in my answers to the CFPB - XXXX claiming to be servicers for XXXX XXXX and then admitting to being owner and holder of a loan that apparently does not exist according to THEIR OWN title company which cleared me to close on this loan increase. No first lien showed up - only a judgement from my ex husband which I promptly paid. I assumed that the company had done the right thing and removed themselves from my title - because no one can claim a holder status to foreclose on you if they're not on the title right? In fact - according to the law - only a holder in due course can sue the prior lien holders and New Rez is admittedly not a holder in due course. So, effectively, New Rez has been collecting my monthly payments since the beginning of this improper action all the while trying to sue themselves for the proceeds of the HELOC that I never missed a payment on and they themselves have continued to take the entire time they improperly had me in court.. The appraisal was also paid for and all was ok - so I was told. I hadn't heard anything so I called a few times and left messages with the loan officer. Today I went to the website to pay XXXX - since the loan officer instructed me to miss XXXX payments - I was unsure as to which XXXX so I made XXXXXXXX XXXX payment. According to XXXX website today- my loan has a star in the default column and no equity shows up at all and the number listed is the loss mitigation department. This loan was never even late and I would like an explanation as to why my loan is now in default status. This company never had any right to hold up my life, steal my equity and even take me to court let alone keep me from my equity now.

I will need a copy of all phone records, a copy of all
loan documents including the appraisal and the title search. They may have denied my rights to due process, XXXX and a fair trial but they are not getting away with stealing my equity any longer. This is a criminal enterprise and the CFPB has aided and abetted their operation long enough. Literally, my last complaint to this agency resulted in them admitting they switched positions and you guys did nothing. You are allowing these corporations to steal homes from law abiding American CITIZENS- and you all already knew that XXXX  XXXX XXXX had no authority to service anything when this fiasco began.

3/28/24,Prepaid card,General-purpose prepaid card,Trouble using the card,Trouble using the card to spend money in a store or online,"Writing this XXXX : I purchased five {$100.00} XXXX gift cards at XXXX 's on XXXX for a work contest. The cards were at my house until I saw the winner on XXXX. When the giftcard winner tried to use them this week, four had a {$0.00} balance and one had {$4.00} on it. The winner asked me if this was a cruel joke, me giving her blank gift cards - I am mortified!!! 

I visited the website on the back of the card, XXXX. I could see on the card with the {$4.00} balance that 2 purchases were made on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX in California. I live in AZ, and flew from XXXX to XXXX XXXX on XXXX, via XXXX ( NOT Cali ). 

I called the XXXX customer service # on the back of one of the cards and was treated like a criminal. They would only take one of the card 's info and said i needed to make separate calls for each of the cards. I have no idea how cards can be used when I have the physical cards, they were never out of my possession, and the backs were not ripped off revealing the pin code. 

I am inquiring if there is any recourse for the {$500.00} plus {$6.00} XXXX fee per card, total out of pocket is {$530.00} ( receipt attached ). 

I have submitted my purchase receipt and images of all the cards from the person who received the cards as a winning gift. 

On the website, I was originally able to enter the card info and saw the two CA purchases. After speaking with giftcard customer service, all of the cards were no longer visible ; so, they were purchased together, are tied to each other, and the giftcard person I spoke with shut them all down which leaves me no access to view or fight the stolen charges. They've left me in the dark, with no recourse, and they hang up you ( happened with both calls to them to work this out ). 

Something funny is going on with this company ; too many complaints online for there not to be. 

The website and customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. Please let me know if I have any recourse.

This letter serves as a written request pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ). 
I dispute the validity of the debt that you claim I owe and request that you provide verification of the debt, including the original creditor 's name and address, the amount owed, wet ink signature, My fingerprints, Original contract, and proof that you are licensed to collect debts in my state ( if you are a debt collector ). Until such time as you provide verification of the debt, I am exercising my right to cease and desist all collection activities. Please furnish evidence and proof not statements on how you verified the debt. Statements are hearsay in the court of law. Please do not send any statements. I will question the authenticity of any statements sent. 
I demand removal for failure to produce the original contract. It is alleged debt until it can be proven. With no supporting evidence it must come off the report. 
Furthermore, I am requesting that all communication regarding this debt be conducted in writing only. Please do not contact me by phone, email, or any other means except in writing. Any further attempts to collect this debt without providing verification or in violation of the FDCPA will result in legal action being taken against your agency. 
IF YOU OR ANY OTHER AGENT OF YOUR COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT ME OR CONTINUE REPORTING THE ALLEGED DEBT, A FORMAL COMPLAINT WILL BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. 
Please move forward with the above request. Failure to complete request I will sue for each violation not limited to but including reporting information without my consent, invading my privacy, and defamation of character under permissible purpose ( 15 usc 1681 ) In closing, please acknowledge receipt of this letter and confirm that you have ceased all collection and reporting activities on this debt.

4/4/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Citibank regarding their handling of a debt collection matter, which I believe constitutes a violation of consumer protection laws at both the federal and state levels. 

I was served with a lawsuit initiated by Citibank alleging non-payment of a debt related to a credit card account. The debt in question originated from a credit card issued by Citibank, Upon reviewing the original credit card agreement provided by Citibank, I discovered a binding arbitration clause, which states : This arbitration clause is significant as it establishes the agreed-upon method for resolving disputes related to the credit card account. It specifies that disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration, replacing the right to go to court, have a jury trial, or initiate or participate in a class action. Furthermore, it outlines the procedures, limitations, and requirements for arbitration, emphasizing arbitration as the primary mechanism for dispute resolution. 

Citibank 's decision to pursue litigation in court instead of adhering to the arbitration provision outlined in the credit card agreement constitutes a breach of contract. Their failure to abide by the terms of the arbitration clause violates the contractual agreement entered with me. 

Furthermore, Citibank 's actions have several legal consequences : Enforcement of Arbitration Clause : I request that the CFPB take appropriate action to ensure that Citibank complies with the arbitration provision and dismisses the court case. Citibank should be compelled to resolve disputes through arbitration as outlined in the contract. 

Federal Arbitration Act ( FAA ) : The FAA governs the enforcement of arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce. Under the FAA, arbitration agreements are generally favored and must be enforced according to their terms. Citibank 's failure to abide by the arbitration provision is a violation of the FAA since it acted contrary to the agreement 's requirements.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Regulations : Citibank 's actions are against the guidelines and regulations established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). One area of focus for the CFPB is ensuring fair and transparent practices in consumer financial products and services. This includes scrutinizing the use of arbitration agreements and dispute resolution processes by financial institutions like Citibank.

In the case of Citibank 's failure to comply with the arbitration clause in the credit card agreement, the CFPB should investigate whether Citibank 's actions align with its guidelines and regulations. This could involve assessing whether Citibank 's handling of the dispute resolution process adequately protects consumers ' rights and ensures fair treatment.

Sanctions or Penalties : Parties who disregard arbitration agreements or engage in litigation in violation of contractual provisions should face appropriate sanctions or penalties. I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly and consider imposing sanctions against Citibank if it is found to have violated the arbitration clause.

In addition to federal law, Citibank 's actions have violated California consumer protection laws, including but not limited to : Unfair Competition Law ( UCL ) : Citibank 's disregard for the arbitration provision violates California 's UCL because its unfair and deceptive.

California Consumer Legal Remedies Act ( CLRA ) : Citibank 's actions violate CLRA rules. In the context of Citibank 's actions, Citibank 's disregard for the arbitration provision constitutes an unfair and deceptive business practice, Citibank 's failure to comply with the arbitration clause is deceptive and unfair behavior under the CLRA, as it may mislead consumers about their rights and options for dispute resolution.

Contract Law : Citibank 's failure to comply with the arbitration clause may constitute a breach of contract under California law. In the case of Citibank 's failure to comply with the arbitration clause in the credit card agreement, it constitutes a breach of contract under California law. The arbitration clause represents a material term of the contract, establishing the agreed-upon method for resolving disputes between Citibank and the cardholder. When Citibank initiated litigation in court instead of adhering to the arbitration provision, it disregarded a fundamental aspect of the contract. By failing to fulfill their obligation to resolve disputes through arbitration as outlined in the agreement, Citibank breached the terms of the contract.

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate Citibank 's practices in this matter and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure compliance with federal and state consumer protection laws. Additionally, I seek guidance on the appropriate steps to resolve this dispute and protect my rights as a consumer.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in addressing this issue.

Then they repossessed my car illegally. They are trying to get me to pay an additional {$4000.00}, and now the finance company is recalling the loan even after I've made my first car payment. The Dealership and Start Auto Finance are working together because when I called the branch manager, XXXX, she said I need to show proof I paid the full down payment, which I did according to the contract. He made a bill of sale with no dates and added fraudulent dates. Now they have my car and are trying to keep my down payment. I'm also filing complaints with DHSMV and OFR. Additionally, they are trying to charge me repo fees illegally, and they were not even allowed to repo my car. The finance company claimed they paid them, but when I spoke to XXXX, she said they have not paid them. I'm not sure how that is even legal when they sent me my welcome letter, and I paid my initial car payment. Also, they are trying to charge me to get my personal belongings and keep items out of my car. The repo guy, XXXX XXXX, stole items out of my car, and all three of these companies are working together illegally. His LLC is inactive when I looked on XXXX as well. I've filed every complaint I can as these companies are committing bank fraud. they are keeping my down payment, the car, not returning my plates or personal belongings. They are trying to resale my car on XXXX and keeping all my money. I'm not in any default of any contracts that they are claiming. Start Auto Finance is working completely illegally with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they both need to be investigated because I know I'm not the only victim. there are tons of complaints on both companies. 
I upheld all my stipulations, but XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX intentionally stalled the process. They repossessed my car on XX/XX/24, even though I submitted all documents on XX/XX/24. They deliberately gave me the runaround, timing it on a Friday evening to hinder communication. Finally, I reached XXXX on Monday, but she made me wait until Tuesday for my contracts. She demanded proof of full down payment, which I had already provided as per our contract. On our interview call, I clearly stated that the down payment was made. It's evident that XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are colluding to defraud me. I submitted a copy of my receipt that I paid to start auto and it clearly states no side loans or balances!

It has recently come to my attention that there are multiple clear violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) associated with this account. As such, I am requesting immediate action to address and rectify these issues. 

I hereby formally request a comprehensive debt validation, which should encompass the following details : Original Contract : I demand a complete copy of the original contract between the purported creditor and myself regarding the account STFARMBNK XXXX. 
Original Creditor : Please clearly identify the name and contact information of the original creditor linked to this account. 
Original Open Date : Provide the precise date when the account STFARMBNK XXXX was initially established. 
Date of Last Payment : Specify the exact date of the most recent payment made concerning this account. 
Date Account Was Closed : Indicate the official closure date of the account STFARMBNK XXXX. 
I am fully aware of my rights under the FCRA, and it is evident that your company has failed to fulfill its obligations in ensuring the accuracy and validity of reported information. I insist on a prompt response and resolution to address these discrepancies. 

Failure to comply with this request within 15 days from the date of this correspondence will leave me with no choice but to pursue legal action to enforce my rights under the FCRA. Please consider this letter as a formal notice of my intent to proceed accordingly.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,IL,60651,,Consent provided,Web,4/4/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8696923

I sold my existing travel trailer and wanted to apply a {$25000.00} principal payment to the loan. The only way to apply the payment is to prepay the loan installments. By not applying the proceeds to principal and only prepaying the installments, this only saves me a nominal amount of interest. If the bank allowed a payment of principal it would provide the benefit of a more rapid amortization and shorten the term of the loan. The bank only allows principal payments to be applied on Home Equity loans.

4/4/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"Dear Sir/Madam : Please give my concerns in this complaint letter your immediate attention. 

I have the following complaint/concerns : Attn : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Billing Error Department of US Bank Re : Billing Error Acct No. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Reserve, XXXX, XXXX & Central Billing Account XXXX Please provide your immediate attention ; pursuant to 18 USC 1348 Securities & Commodities Fraud : First, per the FCRA, as a federally protected consumer, I am opting out of any & all authorization I the consumer may have provided you, written & unwritten, verbal & nonverbal, per 15 USC 6802, effective immediately & indefinitely. 

Per Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 244, I have provided US Bank a notarized POA revocation ( attached ) in addition to filing form 2848 with the IRS. I request US Bank promptly provide me with all 1099s filed on my accounts.

US Bank has accepted all of my instruments of payments ( bonds & endorsed dividend checks "" coupons '' ) per 31 CFR 328.5 & 328.6 ; however, have not recently applied credit to my accounts, causing a "" lock '' on my central billing account, per a US Bank representative I spoke with yesterday, named XXXX XXXX. For the record, Wisconsin Statute 16.413 ( 1 ) ( a ) defines a Financial Instrument as any check, draft, warrant, money order, note, certificate of deposit, letter of credit, bill of exchange, credit or credit card, transaction authorization mechanism, marketable security, and any computer representation of them. I was also informed, yesterday, by my regular public US bank manager, that there was an error on the accounting of XXXX which is not visible to me, and will quickly lead to a "" charge off '' and subsequent closing of all my accounts without my authorization in addition to default reporting to my consumer credit. 

I've been a loyal customer, both personal & business, of US Bank for 29 years, providing them thousands of securities from my own clients. I've recently become privy to deceptive contractual language and dealership fraud, along with securities fraud, using commercial paper to evade taxes and corporations keeping proceeds from my securities being traded on the secondary market. I've politely informed both XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX of my knowledge & acceptance of this, that because I've had a good relationship with US Bank for decades, I was not going to revoke POA or ask for my security proceeds to be returned to me. They did acknowledge my emails and informed me I would be receiving response correspondence shortly, which has not come to fruition. 

Under the Provisions of 12 CFR 1026.13 - Billing Error Resolution Please provide documentary evidence my certificates of indebtedness have not been sent to the treasury to be sold on the international market for corporation monetary gain as they have not been applied to my US Bank accounts via the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( EFTA ) per my request via registered mail received XX/XX/XXXX to the trustee who signed under oath in a personal capacity pursuant to the Security Exchange Act of 1933. 

I, the consumer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, request documentary evidence of my contracts with US Bank, conspicuously demonstrating I owe payment currency of any kind & US Bank does not owe me interest dividend payments earned every four weeks in the form of coupons defined as definitive bearer interest instruments associated with U.S. Treasury bearer securities.

In reference to the Trustee Indenture Act of 1933 : Fiduciaries act on behalf of others & are required to put the clients interests ahead of their own, with a duty to preserve good faith & trust. Fiduciaries are legally & ethically bound to act in the others best interests. Investors lend money to corporations in return for a pre-established number of interest payments, along with the return of their principal upon the bond 's maturity date. A coupon rate is the nominal yield paid by a fixed-income security.

The SEA of 1934 was a response to the widely held belief irresponsible financial practices were one of the chief causes of the XXXX stock market crash. 

Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, Chapter 53 4302, the words "" to trade, '' as used herein, shall be deemed to mean ( a ) Pay, satisfy, compromise, or give security for the payment or satisfaction of any debt or obligation. ( b ) Draw, accept, pay, present for acceptance or payment, or endorse any negotiable instrument or chose in action. ( c ) Enter into, carry on, complete, or perform any contract, agreement, or obligation. ( d ) Buy or sell, loan or extend credit, trade in, deal with, exchange, transmit, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of, or receive any form of property. 

I hereby revoke 80 % of security interests withheld from me for all past, present and future certificates of indebtedness & authorize US Bank, per the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 USC 1693, to transfer said securities into to my US Bank Account XXXX Routing XXXX. US Bank may apply 20 % of my security interests in the primary & secondary markets, to trade for the maximum amount of use to meet their short term obligations. 

Per 12 CFR 1026.13, the following provisions apply : I need not pay & US Bank may not collect any portion of payment related to this dispute. 

US Bank shall not make any adverse report of my credit standing. 

Acceleration of debt & restriction of these accounts are prohibited. 

You shall not restrict or close these accounts solely because I have exercised my rights in good faith provided by this section. 

You may be subject to the forfeiture penalty under 15 USC 1666 ( e ) for failure to comply with any of the requirements of this section. 

You are to issue a refund of 80 % of the interest generated from my certificates of indebtedness dividend payment treasury coupons- past, present & perpetually and furnish me with all 1099s filed on my account.

Since a debt can not be paid with a debt, my FRNs must be returned.

Per 12 CFR 1026.13 ( c ) ( 1 ) - You shall deliver written acknowledgment to me within 30 days of receiving this billing error notice. I may be contacted in writing at the above address, or by email at XXXX. 

Thank you for addressing this billing error promptly. I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

4/5/24,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that a new collection amount was detected on my credit file from a company called Credit Management , LP. It had been reported by XXXX. I have never done business with this company. I contacted XXXX, who was not particularly helpful. The XXXX XXXX stated that they did not see any negative information on my credit file. After checking with XXXX XXXX Works online, I saw a collections amount of {$1300.00} posted on my credit file by Credit Management , LP. They claimed to have opened this collections case on XX/XX/XXXX. At no time have I ever been called, mailed, emailed, faxed or contacted in any way whatsoever by Credit Management , LP. I called XXXX XXXX Works on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and was connected with a Restoration Specialist/XXXX. * On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, the Restoration Specialist/XXXX attempted to contact Credit Management XXXX for XXXX XXXX way call about this matter, but Credit Management LP was closed. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX Restoration Specialist XXXX made a second successful 3 way call to Credit Management LP . THIS CALL WAS RECORDED IN ITS ENTIRETY. The Credit Management LP rep* stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX turned this case over to them. She asked for my name and address, which I gave. She stated that the last payment received was in XXXX, XXXX, and that the XXXX XXXX disconnection date was in XXXX, XXXX. However, she did not disclose the name of the person owing XXXX {$1300.00}, nor the address of the disconnected service. I have lived at the same address since XXXX, and XXXX knows who does/does not have service and when. I told the Credit Management LP rep that they have posted a false report on my credit file, and I am not the person owing XXXX  {$1300.00}. She stated that "" she can only go by what's in front of her. '' I was directed to go the Credit Management LP website and file a dispute claim, plus attach supporting documents. I attempted to do this at this website address that was given : creditmanagementonline.com Their directions begin with asking for the claimant 's account number. I do not have a Credit Management LP account number. The XX/XX/XXXX 3-way call initiated by the XXXX Restoration XXXX /XXXX  is the only contact I've ever had with Credit Management LP . They're the ones who issues account numbers. Therefore, a dispute claim could not be filed. The Credit Management LP rep asked for my address and telephone number, and if it's okay if they contact me. Her company not even having my contact information in their system proves I've been wrongfully treated. I was also directed to file a police report for identity theft, but I do not believe identity theft has occurred. Identity theft victims receive a barrage of bills for expensive purchases they never made, have their bank accounts drained, creditors hounding them, etc. The sole occurrence that has happened to me is Credit Management LP posting a false and injurious collections claim on my EXCELLENT credit file. Upon googling this company, a multitude of stories regarding false reports of collections by them come up. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has received hundreds of complaints regarding their disreputable actions.

For more detailed information reference report number- XXXX from ftc claim. I have all hard copies of any texts, communication, emails, and phone records where Inwas made to stay in line with my loan officer named XXXX XXXX using the phone number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. Ultimately Was told they had to access my account to transfer insurance deposit to verify validity of my account and the next day I would have to transfer back via XXXX XXXX. When I stated I had never used XXXX XXXX XXXX became very aggressive and stated this would only further delay my process and would need to be at XXXX the next morning as soon as they opened at XXXX to transfer money back. I asked multiple questions surrounding this process to include why cant i go to my bank and ensure it is transferred correctly. And still very aggressive, stated he would be calling me at XXXX the next morning to verify the funds went into my account and to talk to me until they were transferred back ( {$1900.00} ). Later that evening, received a text from bank regarding account being locked due to multiple unsuccessful attempts to login. XXXX called and stated his team was informed Inhad changed my bank credentials and he needed them asap and for me not to sign in again until the process was complete. I told him I never authorized a single person from his company to sign into my bank account and asked how they accessed it. I told him i refused to give them any type of access to my login credentials and if there was any information needed, they would communicate those needs with myself and I would determine if appropriate request. About XXXX XXXX  later, received another text asking if the funds cleared so signed in and saw I had XXXX returned checks and a pending XXXX each for approx {$970.00}. Checks were written from a company in XXXX Texas with my name forged on the back. I knew at this point I had been scammed but didnt know to what degree. I went ahead and called bank to make them aware of the first XXXX checks and pending XXXX check. The next morning XXXX called at XXXX, I made sure my husband was present and witnessing and XXXX demanded i transfer all the funds to a XXXX XXXX XXXX that came up with the name XXXX XXXX XXXX i asked multiple questions and he refused to answer. I was unable to transfer to full amount due to security limits I have in place for safeguards like this so he made me sit on the phone and transfer small amounts until I reached the {$1900.00}. As soon as I reached it, he was extremely hurried to get off the phone and I demanded an update on when to expect my loan to be submitted to my account. He stated he would call in XXXX hours with an update and funds would be available by that time. Never heard back from him and I texted multiple times inquiring about an update and have not heard back. Obviously all XXXX fraudulent checks were returned so that money has since credited back to my account however the {$1900.00} will not be refunded by my bank as they denied my claim prior to receiving any evidence, I had not yet received my paperwork in the mail to sign the affidavit and provide further details and they stated I received a benefit from this transaction which could not be further from the truth. Instead, I have a checking account with negative {$2100.00}, my paycheck is deposited into that account every XXXX weeks but given timing was unable to intercept by payroll so currently living off no paycheck for XXXX weeks with XXXX  because they cant give me that money with a negative balance. Truist denied each of my claims less than XXXX hours after filing which is inappropriate and against their stated protocol for these investigations and I have tried any and every branch of the company to get answers or how to just get someone to listen to actually what happened and look at the hard evidence that supports every single claim and how none of the names match up with the company directory, etc and more importantly how they didnt even inform their client ( myself ) of XXXX large deposited fraudulent checks that were clearly not even remotely near my signature. I feel completely defeated by the system and have lost all trust and faith in not only Truist whom my family has banked with for years ( formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX which we loved and had no issues ever with customer service or not feeling safe ) but the process of a fair investigation when you have been victimized by fraud and scam. They have offered no advice, assistance, anything on how to at a minimum recover the {$1900.00} that I have written and notarized transcript of the phone call demanding the transfer of funds and also feel its completely inappropriate to not find a solution to allow me to access my paycheck that I work tirelessly week in. And out XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in our community. This has turned my families life upside down and as recently as this past weekend when calling to get an update from Truist Fraud claim center, an employee hung up on me because it was XXXX and they closed. I please ask for the sake of other families that are going thru the is nightmare that at a minimum a fair investigation is afforded.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,SC,29169,,Consent provided,Web,4/2/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8681745

4/5/24,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"I was contacted by Grant & Weber regarding a debt claimed to be in my name. When I first communicated with their point of contact, they claimed to have no actual detail- just an amount I supposedly owe. The representative indicated they would get more information and contact me back. A couple months later they began to reach out, and after receiving a voice mail, I returned the call. I was told that I had opened an account with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Union, and I believe the claim was that the account was deposited into, but then overrun. The account is not mine and I have never had any relationship or application to this credit union located in California. I was never contacted by the credit union and there was no record of the credit union in my otherwise perfect credit reports prior to Grant & Weber aggresively asserting I owe a debt which has relation to me. They claimed I applied for the account and they have evidence of whatever debt I supposedly owe - they had personally identifying information and an address from 12 years ago, which is why I am concluding this is identity theft. They indicated they would provide such evidence and have not. Rather a week after my last verbal communication ( letter dated XX/XX/2024 ), they send a demand notice requiring payment by XX/XX/2024. The invalid debt is for XXXX amounts of {$4900.00} and {$4900.00}. I have taken action to file a dispute with XXXX will similarly be doing so with XXXX and XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Grant & Weber,FL,32839,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/5/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8705661

2/19/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Subject : Urgent Notice Regarding Unlawful Credit Reporting - Missouri FCRA and Identity Theft Fraud Laws Referenced Dear AMER CR ACPT, I am compelled to address a grave violation concerning the unauthorized dissemination of my personal credit information to reporting agencies, a clear breach of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under Sections 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), 1681c ( a ) ( 2 ), and 1681s-2 ( a ), as well as the Missouri Identity Theft Prevention Act, specifically 570.223. 

It has come to my immediate attention that AMER CR ACPT, Account Number : XXXX, has engaged in such unauthorized reporting without procuring my explicit consent. It is imperative to underscore that under federal law, as delineated in the FCRA, the consumer 's consent is an absolute prerequisite for any such reporting activity pursuant to Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ).

Furthermore, Missouri state law, particularly the Missouri Identity Theft Prevention Act, underscores the gravity of unauthorized access and misuse of personal information, emphasizing the necessity of explicit consumer consent.

I wish to unequivocally affirm that I have not provided consent for AMER CR ACPT, Account Number : XXXX, to disseminate any information to my credit report. This flagrant absence of explicit permission constitutes a severe violation of my rights, potentially compromising my creditworthiness and displaying a blatant disregard for federal and state laws. 

I demand, with the utmost urgency, that AMER CR ACPT, Account Number : XXXX, immediately cease any further dissemination of my personal credit information to reporting agencies without procuring my explicit consent, as mandated by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and the Missouri Identity Theft Prevention Act. Failure to comply within the stipulated 30-day timeframe will be construed as deliberate noncompliance, subject to penalties under applicable laws, including identity theft fraud laws. 

It is imperative to understand that procuring consent is not a discretionary action but a legal obligation under these specific provisions of the FCRA, Missouri state law, and identity theft fraud statutes. This is not a negotiable matter ; it is a directive for adherence to both federal and state regulations, safeguarding consumers like myself from unauthorized and injurious credit reporting practices. 

I anticipate your immediate attention to this matter and trust that AMER CR ACPT, Account Number : XXXX, will expeditiously rectify these egregious violations, upholding my rights under federal and state laws. 

Sincerely,",,"American Credit Acceptance, LLC",MO,63141,,Consent provided,Web,2/19/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8371215
